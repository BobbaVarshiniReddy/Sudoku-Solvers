# Sudoku-Solvers
# Optimized Sudoku Solver Using Backtracking & Bitmasking

An efficient 9×9 Sudoku solver built using **recursive backtracking** combined with **bitmasking** to minimize constraint-checking time. This project demonstrates strong problem-solving and optimization techniques using low-level bit operations.

## Features

-  Solves standard 9×9 Sudoku puzzles with high efficiency
-  Validates number placement using bitmasking for O(1) constraint checks
-  Uses recursive backtracking for complete solution traversal
-  Greatly reduced runtime compared to naive approaches
-  Handles puzzles with multiple empty cells and ensures valid placement

##  Technologies Used

-  Language: C++
-  Techniques: Backtracking, Bitmasking, Recursive DFS
-  Tested with: Multiple valid Sudoku configurations
